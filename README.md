# Cross-CMS Compliance Coalition

This repository has been created as result of the meeting between Heather Burns (from WordPress Core Privacy Team) and some members of the Joomla Compliance Team.

The aim of this repo is to have a common space where to collect and share knowledge and information about Compliance with Data Privacy regulations.

Read our meeting minutes: [Meeting Minutes December 06, 2018](https://volunteers.joomla.org/teams/compliance-team/reports/924-cross-cms-privacy-compliance-initiative-december-0)

The attendees would hope that the meeting could result as the foundation of this new cross-community initiative and would like to invite Chris Teitzel and other members from the WordPress, Drupal and Joomla Communities to join this informal group and share their knowledge and efforts.

If you want to join the initiative feel free to contact compliance@community.joomla.org
