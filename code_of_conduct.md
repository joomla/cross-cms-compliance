## Project participation guidelines

All participants in the cross-CMS privacy working group are here working voluntarily across our projects. We work in a spirit of mutual collaboration, respect, friendship, and openness. 

Contributors to the working group are here as representatives of their respective projects. Contributors therefore agree to follow their own project Code(s) of Conduct and/or community participation guidelines, in their work within and on behalf of the group, as if they were working internally. This applies to work remotely and online as well as any in-person work we may do.

For universal values outside our individual projects, we use the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) to define our expectations of each other as well as what constitutes unacceptable behavior. In the event that a contributor's project does not have a Code of Conduct and/or set of community participation guidelines, or if two project Codes of Conduct differ on their interpretation of issues, the working group will use the principles set out in the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) as our defining reference.

If a contributor or participant wishes to report unacceptable behaviour within the working group by a representative of another project, they should do so through the Code of Conduct and/or community reporting mechanism of that individual's project. Please also report any potentially dangerous situation, active threats/malicious behavior, or a participant in distress, even if the situation is not happening to you. If the individual's project does not have a Code of Conduct or community reporting mechanism, participants in the working group reserve the right to engage a third project's community reporting system/dispute resolution process to act as an independent arbiter.

We may amend these guidelines from time to time.
